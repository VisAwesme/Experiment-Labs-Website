ELRB Team Structure (Revised 2004–2037 Roster)
   (Legacy version: ELRB Teams – Pre-Remaster)

1. Civilian / Base Tier
(Open to all players, no Discord needed)
Test Subject
Clearance: Level 0


Role: Disposable labor and experimental fodder.


Equipment: Prison jumpsuit, wrist ID chip, sometimes issued with low-tier tools (mop, clipboard, flashlight). No weapons permitted.


Summary: Comprised of new arrivals from high-security prisons, test subjects serve as expendable manpower for experiments, facility labor, or… disposal. Mortality rate is considered “statistically acceptable.”


Concept Art Space: [Insert prisoner in jumpsuit with barcode ID]


Research Visitor
Clearance: Level 1/Visitor Pass 


Role: Civilian observers and guest scientists.


Equipment: Clipboard, lab badge, basic research tools (microscopes, scanners, low-level keycards).


Summary: Granted limited access to safe zones of the facility. Useful for gathering data and lore exposure without risking high clearance. Always monitored by security.


Concept Art Space: [Insert civilian researcher with visitor pass]



2. Research & Development Division
(Scientific and experimental personnel — DA required beyond Visitors)
Experimental Research Division (ERD)
Clearance: Level 3


Role: Core scientists investigating aberrations, CCT, and other high-risk anomalies.


Equipment: White hazard-resistant lab coats, anomaly scanners, prototype containment tools.


Summary: Handle theoretical work and design containment procedures. Their reports feed directly into PED and CRU.


Concept Art Space: [Insert scientist with tablet + containment tube]


Containment Research Unit (CRU)
Clearance: Level 3


Role: Chemical, biohazard, and volatile entity specialists.


Equipment: Hazmat suits, reinforced gloves, specialized containment syringes, chemical dispersal units.


Summary: Sent to handle spills, leaks, and active entity exposure. Operate in sealed labs with emergency kill-switches.


Concept Art Space: [Insert hazmat team member in sealed chamber]


Anomaly Research & Response Team (ARRT)
Clearance: Level 3


Role: Direct anomaly field research.


Equipment: Multi-spectrum scanners, portable neutralization kits, Class-3 containment canisters.


Summary: Investigate unexplained phenomena, capture field data, and sometimes… disappear. Known as the “ARRT Rats” by Security.


Concept Art Space: [Insert anomaly scanning unit with glowing equipment]


Technology & Development Group (TDG)
Clearance: Level 2–3 (depending on project)


Role: Robotics, AI, and system engineering.


Equipment: Welding tools, repair drones, advanced coding rigs, prototype cybernetics.


Summary: Keep the facility alive through upgrades. Responsible for drone swarms, security AI, and the questionable “self-learning doors” incident.


Concept Art Space: [Insert engineer with robotic arm prototype]


Prototyping & Engineering Division (PED)
Clearance: Level 3–4


Role: Experimental weapon and tech builders.


Equipment: Prototype weapons (plasma cutters, railgun sidearms), test drones, structural exosuits.


Summary: Take theoretical concepts and push them to unsafe trial runs. The line between “progress” and “hazard” is dangerously thin.


Concept Art Space: [Insert engineer with prototype handheld railgun]



3. Security & Emergency Response Division
(Handles threats, breaches, and protection of the facility)
Facility Security Task Force (FSTF)
Clearance: Level 2


Role: Guards and rapid-response combat units.


Equipment: Standard-issue rifles, riot shields, ballistic armor, comms units.


Summary: Protect restricted areas, neutralize intruders, and act as frontline responders during breaches.


Concept Art Space: [Insert armored guard patrolling hall]


Emergency Containment Specialists (ECS)
Clearance: Level 3


Role: Biohazard and contamination control.


Equipment: Hazmat armor, chemical sprayers, radiation meters, sterilization drones.


Summary: Deployed during chemical leaks, viral outbreaks, and reactor malfunctions. Survival rate varies depending on what got loose.


Concept Art Space: [Insert hazmat operator with containment sprayer]


Emergency Evacuation Task Force (EETF)
Clearance: Level 2–3


Role: Civilian extraction during disasters.


Equipment: Megaphones, light batons, breaching charges for locked exits, armored evac trucks.


Summary: Trained in crowd control and emergency triage. Known for dragging terrified Test Subjects out of fire zones.


Concept Art Space: [Insert evac team guiding civilians]


Structural Repair & Operations (SRO)
Clearance: Level 1–2


Role: Facility maintenance & critical repairs.


Equipment: Welding torches, power grid kits, structural foam sealants, portable generators.


Summary: Unsung heroes that keep the underground base standing. Usually the first to die when they’re sent to “patch a wall” in a breach zone.


Concept Art Space: [Insert welder fixing broken bulkhead]


Aberration Containment Unit (ACU)
Clearance: Level 4


Role: Elite aberration hunters.


Equipment: Tranquilizer cannons, reinforced restraints, electromagnetic containment nets, breacher exosuits.


Summary: Event-only team deployed against escaped anomalies. If ACU fails, the facility doesn’t survive.


Concept Art Space: [Insert heavily armored unit wrangling creature]



4. External Operations Division
(Outside-the-facility exploration, sabotage, and recovery)
Resource Acquisition & Extraction (RAE)
Clearance: Level 2


Role: Collect rare resources and salvage.


Equipment: Mining drills, automated drones, sealed transport crates, terrain vehicles.


Summary: Dig deep into hostile terrain for materials vital to ELRB operations. Mortality rate “varies.”


Concept Art Space: [Insert mining team with exo-loaders]


Exploration & Recon Team (ERT)
Clearance: Level 2–3


Role: Scouts & cartographers.


Equipment: Advanced mapping tools, long-range comms, climbing rigs, camo suits.


Summary: First to explore uncharted tunnels, ruins, or dimensional rifts. Last to be remembered.


Concept Art Space: [Insert recon team in dark tunnels]


Field Recon & Extraction Ops (FREO)
Clearance: Level 3–4


Role: Hybrid recon + live anomaly capture.


Equipment: Capture drones, containment spheres, dart rifles, stealth rigs.


Summary: Specialists in live retrieval missions. Higher prestige than ERT, higher danger than RAE.


Concept Art Space: [Insert operatives dragging glowing container]


TerraFuel Operatives (TFO)
Clearance: Forged (cloned RFID, equivalent to Level 3–4 access)


Role: Rival corporate infiltrators.


Equipment: EMP grenades, hacking rigs, stealth armor, suppressed sidearms, RFID-clone keycards with exposed flipper-zero mods.


Summary: Saboteur role, only playable via gamepass/DA. Known for breaching restricted areas by mass-producing cloned ELRB keycards. Their success = ELRB’s suffering.


Concept Art Space: [Insert cloaked operative breaching ELRB gate]



5. High Staff / Administrative Division
(Leadership, oversight, and restricted ranks)
Facility Overseers (FO)
Clearance: Level 4


Role: Administrative directors with near-total control.


Equipment: Master keycards, override terminals, nuclear codes, access to surveillance AI.


Summary: Decide who lives, who dies, and when the failsafes are armed.
