Aberration Anatomy and Physiology
Key Notes:
The term "aberration" refers to organisms transformed into aberrated humanoids or creatures.
Aberrated may describe the material composing their forms, the viral body, or the multi-cellular being itself.
This document outlines the biology of aberrations in their humanoid or creature forms.

General Physiology
Basic Biology Overview Aberrations diverge from the principles of animal biology. Their forms consist of unstable genetic material. Rapid growth of aberrated cells has a resemblance to that of cancerous cells, the difference being aberrated cells are capable of inserting their DNA into other cells they touch. This makes aberration highly zoonotic, vulnerability and long exposure can result in a higher risk of aberration.
Cellular Structure: Post-transformation, the host’s cellular structure is replaced by aberrated cells. This transformation erases most biological disorders, injuries, and physical deformities from the host. Do note, physical deformities can still occur and scar aberrations after transformation.

Exoskeletal Components: Some aberrated species incorporate bone structures within their cells, forming horns, claws, or armor-like exoskeletons. Despite their rigidity, these structures may retain properties like malleability and contagion.
Aberration Traits The defining characteristics of aberrations are their unstable genetic composition, allowing for a multitude of unique forms:
Quadruped State: One of the more common forms of aberrations; this manifestation originates from converted quadrupedal animals. These aberrations still enact a majority of the original behaviors from the species (e.g., territorialism, marking). When presented with an unaberrated organism, aberrated quadrupeds react with predation regardless of its origin. It is important to note that quadrupedal aberrations are identical physically to their unaberrated counterparts, once the contagion is passed from quadruped to a bipedal human is where the documented unusual properties begin to arise.
Humanoid State: Once converted, the aberrated species adopts the physical traits resembling the genetic template they’re based on (e.g., feline, aquatic). Their surface texture ranges from fur, scales, or skin while retaining underlying flexibility.
Shape Manipulation: Some aberrated species can partially reshape or distort their forms to pass through tight spaces. To distort their form requires extreme physical dislocation of joints and tearing of tissues, it is for this reason the ability to do this is species-dependent and energy-intensive.
Weight and Density: Certain aberrations are unnaturally lightweight due to their unique material density. This allows them to resist gravitational constraints but leaves them vulnerable to suction currents or high winds. As of now,  #018-4 and are the only documented case of this.

Conversion Process
Hosts exposed to contamination through physical contact, inhalation, or ingestion undergo a transformation that mirrors the genetic coding of the aberrated species involved. The involvement of aberrated biological material making contact with normal cells results in a process similar to cancer metastasis.
The conversion manifests hypoesthesia, a complete loss of sensation, followed by a violent shift to the host’s new aberrated physiology. 
The process is often described as excruciatingly painful, then full body sensation leaves before coming back with severe mental disorientation, leaving the transformed individual with fragmented memories.

Aberration Systems
Sensory Systems An aberrated species retains its functional sight, smell, taste, touch, and hearing, with some additional features:
Vision: Retains the original optical capabilities of the unaberrated individual, but may include enhancements like night vision (in animals adapted to low visibility) or thermal detection (in predatory variants).
Touch: Kinetic sensitivity varies by aberrated species but is generally heightened, allowing fine manipulation of objects. Though the hand structure of some species makes holding objects uncomfortable.
Hearing: If originated from a species lacking auditory structures, the aberration perceives sound through vibrational feedback.

Physical Systems
Strength and Agility: Depending on the species template, aberrated beings may exhibit increased strength (e.g., tiger-based species) or enhanced flexibility and speed (e.g., aquatic or feline species).
Respiration: Mostly standard respiratory systems, will differentiate between aberrated species origins(e.g., Aquatic variants are capable of indefinite submersion due to water-adaptive traits, Mammalian variants maintain a standard oxygen respiratory system).
Energy Sources: Aberrated species sustain themselves by converting absorbed biological material into aberrated biology, reinforcing their form. It is observed that some species can obtain energy through photosynthesis and chemosynthesis, some aberrations may additionally consume for pleasure or energy boosts.
Digestive Systems Consumed biology, regardless of its origin, is either digested for food, or assimilated to rebuild the body. This process is efficient but not infallible—aberrated beings remain susceptible to poisons or contaminants.

Additional Traits
Environmental Adaptations
Temperature Resistance: Certain aberrated species exhibit some extremophilic resistances, though this varies by genetic coding. Fire-resistant variants are less common but highly durable.
Hydrophilic Adaptations: Aquatic aberrated species possess water-friendly traits, allowing seamless movement and function underwater.
Exoskeletal Variants Abnormal bone growths, when present, offer increased durability and reflectivity. These features may serve offensive or defensive purposes, depending on their placement (e.g., claws, horns).
Crystals retain some hazardous properties, making them dual-purpose tools for combat and spreading aberrated material.
Behavior and Limitations
Most aberrated beings stay in static forms resembling their genetic base species, and depending on whether or not its unaberrated origin was bipedal or quadrupedal. Upon death, some aberration corpses rapidly decompose into biohazardous puddles.
Aberrated species can be incapacitated by sufficient force to critical areas (e.g., head or central crystalline structures), though their intensified healing factor makes them challenging to subdue.


(Note1: All aberrations are gonna be based off some sort of cryptid/mythological animal in appearance with actual real equivalent animals chosen to represent the mythos creatures -SS)
(Note2: Please underline all project designations except for the bold -SS. Ex: #230-1, #230-1)
Aberration Research Projects
#230-1 - Project Nimbus (rewrite, no more quadrupedalism)
Access Level: L-3
Animal: Domesticated House Cat (rewrite to a “lucky lion”, will still be a house cat)
Genus: Felis catus
Description: A beige to orange Mackerel Tabby cat aberration with a white underbelly and brown stripes throughout its body. Usually its eyes are half-closed with a relaxed posture, often slouched.
Behavior: Though it exhibits a playful side with toys in its chamber, it's naturally lazy. Additionally, #230-1 has strong emotional bondage to its previous owner, and to various other staff present with it during its pre-aberration life. This unique situation makes #230-1 valuable of an asset to the neurological studies of aberrations.
Researchers/Guard Nickname: "(need new name)"
Traits:
Slow reflexes, struggles with quick movements.
Night vision allows it to function in darkness.
Vulnerable to damage due to its small, fragile body.
The aberrated composition of its body makes it resistant to mild impacts.
Containment: #230-1 poses little risk, and as such is held in a light containment block.
Origin: Having originated from a secluded research lab near a dormitory wing, #230-1 was originally one of the researchers' pet cat. It was brought in to assist with the termination of foreign contaminants such as rats, mice, and other such pests. After a week-long absence, #230-1 returned to the research team as an aberration, and was contained swiftly with minimal damage to faculty and staff.

#102-2 - Project Viper (rewrite, no more quadrupedalism)
Access Level: L-4
Animal: African Lion (rewrite to a “gryphon/griffin”)
Genus: 
Description: An aberrated quadrupedal resembling the Indochina Tiger, bright orange with black stripes and a white underbelly. Its fluffy neck and paws resemble the traditional tiger look.
Behavior: #102-2 exhibits the standard aberrated quadruped traits. It inherits most of the behaviors of the African lion, with an additional large appetite for foods. #102-2 provides valuable insight on researching aberration agility.
Researchers/Guard Nickname: "Griffith"
Traits:
Faster than average, with impressive agility.
Possesses claws that are more durable than a normal tiger’s.
More prone to mental stress in high-stress environments.
Containment: #102-2 is currently housed within a standard aberration containment block with reinforced doors, with a specialized room speaker to broadcast jungle ambiance in the containment unit at all times.
Origin: ‘Griffith’ was one of the more exotic animals brought into ELRB as a habituated lion, being housed in the former tropical research sector. After #102-2’s participation in Project Viper, the tropical research sector closed for security and safety purposes.

#121-1 - Project Solace
Access Level: L-3
Animal: Rattlesnake (this is a “Basilisk”) (gonna be an Eastern Diamondback)
Genus: Crotalus adamanteus
Description: A primarily yellow lizard-like aberration, with lighter underbelly, and black to brown spots and a distinct long whip-like barbed tail. (The barbed tail is gonna stay, but i'm recolouring it. -SS) (gonna be an Eastern Diamondback -SS)
Behavior: #121-1 are stealthy, solitary ambush predators shy of conflict. Its preferable hunting grounds are low lit environments with adapted eyes that allow it to detect prey. It has been observed #121-1 instances may utilize their tail and snatch their prey, dragging the victim towards itself. In stressful environments where #121-1 is outnumbered, #121-1 will use their tail structure as a spear to gain distance.
Researchers/Guard Nickname: "WhipTail"
Traits:
Highly adaptable to environments with varying temperatures.
The abnormal tail is an invasive trait, influencing its behavior and ability to track movement.
Resistant to most physical attacks but vulnerable to environmental stress.
Perfected thermal vision allows it to ambush in low visibility environments.
Containment: #121-1 is held within a standard containment block, lightly reinforced to suit the species’ needs. A reminder to all personnel that lights are to be on at all times and not dimmed until regular feeding times.
Origin: An unregulated aberration discovered in the abandoned temperature regulation chamber of the facility, #121-1 genetic source was traced back to the Yellow Leopard Gecko. Prior to its discovery, all experimental yellow leopard geckos vanished from their enclosures, as of now, any leading traces to them have ceased. All documented #121-1 specimens are bipedal, subsequently leading many personnel to believe it was behind the sudden loss of multiple engineer personnel over the span of February.

#225-3 - Project Obsidian (WIP, NEEDS BIG CHANGES)
Access Level: L-5
Animal: Dragon
Genus: (Doesn’t need change, just gotta figure out what real-life animal would be close to a dragon -SS)
Description: A large, black dragon-like aberration with a crystalline scale pattern. It has immense wings but never uses them to fly. Its body is tough, with protective crystalline features.
Behavior: 
Researchers/Guard Nickname: "Fafnir"
Traits:
Immune to most forms of melee damage due to its crystalline structure.
Large and intimidating, capable of withstanding environmental hazards.
Weak to extreme heat, but not completely incapacitated.
Discovered deep within an underground vault containing experimental compounds.
Containment: 
Origin: 

#009-2 - Project Archaic
Access Level: L-3 [Clearance Required]
Animal: Cave Wolf (Basically a Werewolf -SS)
Genus: Canis lupus spelaeus 
Description: A wolf-like aberration covered in dark to light brown, stripes of maroon fur, wildly grown with a natural hunch, extreme bone structures imitate an exterior skeleton paired alongside white glowing eyes. Sensitive to bright light, it relies on its adapted eyes to see its environment. It is important to note that this species of aberration is from an extinct ancestor of the grey wolf. The existence of #009-2 implies the phenomena of aberration has existed since the geological period Chibanian, or informally known as, the Middle Pleistocene.
Behavior: From their carnivorous wolf ancestry, #009-2 predates on weaker aberrations and organisms. The aggressive behaviors of #009-2 are erratic, without warning and when bright lights are present, these aberrations become hyper-aggressive which, if staff are uncareful, can lead to dangerous circumstances. #009-2 generally have the least dense pack numbers of wolf aberrations, with a viewed maximum of 4 or less members. When pups fully grow in a pack, either the matured pup or an older member will leave and join another group. 
Researchers/Guard Nickname: "Fenrir"
Traits:
The exterior skeleton provides strong bulk for protection.
Slightly faster than average due to its smaller body size.
Extremely aggressive when threatened, often attacking without warning.
Highly adapted night vision, sensitive to brighter environments.
Containment: Although aggressive and bulky in nature, #009-2 is contained within a standard containment unit with the exception of dimmer lighting. Night vision cameras are required to monitor this species, bright lights can generally cause environmental stress in #009-2 making it more difficult to handle. Required Clearance, door reinforcements, and additional security officers stationed around #009-2 are deemed necessary for the safety of this aberration species.
Origin: #009-2, one of the first few documentations of aberration, is a highly important asset to Experiment Laboratory Research Base’s efforts. It provides invaluable insight on the geological impact aberration has had on Earth and its history. Originally discovered in the crystallized cavern systems, #009-2 was the apex of the aberrated fauna and flora that filled the caverns. Unlike the other aberrations it was documented with, #009-2 was the only recorded bipedal aberration despite no prior human contact. It is generally assumed the bipedal trait evolved in this species instead of being a trait restricted to converted bipeds, a feat undocumented in any other aberrated species to date.

#133-4 - Project Abyss (WIP, NEEDS BIG CHANGES)
Access Level: L-[REDACTED]
Animal: Wyvern
Genus: 
Description: A wingless light blue dragon-like aberration with black and white smokey scale patterns. It has large white black tipped horns and spikes along the body following the same colour pattern the horns have. It’s resistant to physical damage but vulnerable to flames and chemicals.
Behavior: 
Researchers/Guard Nickname: "Frostburn"
Traits:
Strong resistance to projectile-based attacks like firearms.
Weakness to extreme temperatures, particularly heat.
Appears docile but highly territorial in its designated chamber.
Discovered in the chemical research sector, known for testing hazardous substances.
Containment: 
Origin: 

#299-3 - Project Frostbite
Access Level: L-4
Animal: Snow Leopard/Reindeer (This is gonna be a wendigo snow leopard thing, cuz of the reindeer elements -SS)
Genus: Panthera uncia, Rangifer tarandus
Description: A snow leopard-like aberration with gray and beige fur, black spots, accented by a white underbelly. It has a strikingly out of place set of large light brown antlers and a set of matching hooves for its lower legs. #299-2 has excess skull growth, resulting in a skeletal facial mask that adds notable protection against headblows. Known for its heightened senses, it reacts defensively to certain acidic chemicals.
Behavior: Due to the unique circumstances of #299-2’s origin, snow leopard and the contaminant's (Rangifer Tarandus) behaviors are included in this hybrid. They have a crepuscular activity pattern, and generally a majority of the feline traits for snow leopards. Typically snow leopards are solitary and shy, but due to the contaminant, they are more playful and friendly, living together in herds of ‘Wendipards’.
Researchers/Guard Nickname: "Wiinterk"
Traits:
Highly resistant to acidic chemicals but weakened by extreme heat.
Prefers colder climates and has heightened agility in low temperatures.
Temperament can turn aggressive when exposed to too much heat.
The reindeer traits were invasive and unintentional.
Containment: #299-2 is contained within a standard containment block, equipped with a sensitive temperature system. The containment chamber is regularly fixed at about 10* Celsius to accommodate for #299-2’s sensitivity.
Origin: #299-2 was originally designed for chemical testing around aberrations, however cross-contamination occurred due to improper usage of safety around aberration biohazardous waste. Despite the project’s compromise, #299-2 is otherwise considered a major success, and also a reminder to practice proper management of aberrated materials to avoid cross-contaminating in future experiments.

#100-2 - Project Epidemic
Access Level: L-3
Animal: Grey Wolf (Doesn’t really need much of an explanation, it is quite obviously a zombie -SS)
Genus: Canis lupus
Description: A wolf-like aberration with various greens, a reflective coat, dark undertones and a large biohazard symbol on the back. It’s highly adaptable to confined spaces and has above-average physical durability with an abnormally high rate of infectivity compared to other aberrated mutants.
Behavior: 
Researchers/Guard Nickname: "Zombolf"
Traits:
Exceedingly high rate of infectivity.
Slightly faster than average, especially in confined environments.
Naturally resistant to extreme physical trauma.
Fabricated within a sealed, restricted research chamber meant for high-risk projects.
Containment: 
Origin: #100-2 was the first aberration fabricated, done within a sealed, restricted research chamber meant for high-risk projects. #100-2 is considered the breakthrough to discovering the key of manipulating the unstable genetics of aberrations and is the primary standard researchers build off of. 

#230-3 - Project Glimmer
Access Level: L-5
Animal: Melanistic Grey Wolf (Change to porcupine?) (Update: This is gonna be a Cockatrice -SS) -Reptile+Chicken
Genus: Canis lupus
Description: A grey wolf-like aberration with lighter underbelly fur and a distinctive pair of crystal horns. Differentiating between #230-A and #230-B Chromaquills are body and quill size. #230-A come in smaller size and with larger quills, while #230-B have smaller quills but are typically bigger in size. Crystalline shards and dust are embedded within the fur, providing extra durability.
Behavior: 
Researchers/Guard Nickname: "Chromaquill"
Traits:
Highly resistant to melee-based attacks due to the crystalline properties.
Crystals glow faintly, providing light in dark environments.
Weaker to firearms and high-velocity projectiles.
Found in an experimental lab focusing on crystal-based bioengineering.
Containment: 
Origin: 

#018-4 - Project Sunspot
Access Level: L-4
Animal: Arctic Fox (The FireFox/Kitsune, duh. Maybe lean the palette more into the Northern Lights to fit FireFox mythology? -SS)
Genus: Vulpes Lagopus
Description: A small, bright white vulpine aberration with its tail occasionally catching fire leading it to resemble the mythical firefox. Around the paws and tail end are the iconic black markings of a red fox, but the black fades off giving the look of ash trailing into white. #018-4 is one of the few documented aberrations that are unusually lightweight.
Behavior: 
Researchers/Guard Nickname: "FireFox"
Traits:
Completely resistant to flames and extreme temperatures.
Exposure to heat intensifies healing factor.
Vulnerable to chemical exposure, particularly acidic compounds.
Strangely sensitive to water, resulting in erratic behavior.
Containment: #018-4 is to be kept in an upgraded heat-resistant containment chamber with a sprinkler system. If personnel in it’s containment chamber are in danger, the sprinkler systems are to be activated to prevent #018-4 from performing its signature scorching powers. Once sprinklers are activated, all personnel must immediately leave the chamber and security is to set #018-4’s containment chamber into full lockdown and follow procedures. No personnel is to enter #018-4’s chamber until lockdown has finished.
Origin: Discovered in the wilderness near a geothermal research site where heat was harnessed for energy, #018-1 was not a far off distance from the caves Project Archaic was found in.

#277-3 - Project Mirage (WIP, NEEDS BIG CHANGES)
Access Level: L-5
Animal: Cat
Genus: 
Description: A small black cat-like aberration with neon green swirling patterns. Its eyes glow, and it can hypnotize anyone within its line of sight, inducing a trance-like state.

Access Level: L-[REDACTED]
Animal: Human
Genus: Homosapien
Description: A melted aberration a mangled face dripping out a black, viscous, aberrated material. The top head is covered in long chitinous material with filaments lining it, this allows the aberration to detect environmental changes and communicate with others of its kind from long distances.
Behavior: #270-4 is hostile, with high coordination skills with kin.
Researchers/Guard Nickname: "Hivelings/The Void"
Traits:
Unique capability of contaminating other aberrated creatures, converting them into more of #270-4 instances.
Supernatural senses allow it to detect other beings through materials.
A highly dangerous, collective species with an active telekinetic hivemind.
Upon death, the body rapidly collapses into a contagious puddle of its body, after a set amount of time, deceased #270-4 instances will harden into a flexible material that poses no hazardous contagion, allowing safe interaction.
Containment: Due to the interactions #270-4 instances have with their deceased kin, two containment chambers are designated to #270-4. In the event #270-4 current containment chamber #270-4 is positioned inside is scheduled for a decontamination cycle, one containment chamber must always be emptied for relocation.
Origin: Discovered in the abandoned experimental lab dedicated to the study of artificial intelligence and neural mapping.




ECHO Group (Enhanced Contained Hosts Operations)
The ECHO Group consists of aberrated individuals who have been deemed "safe" for containment and coexistence within the Experiment Labs Research Base (ELRB). These subjects retain varying degrees of their original personalities, memories, and intelligence despite their aberrated properties. The ECHO designation implies a dual existence—beings that echo their former selves while embodying the anomaly that is aberration.
Overview
ECHO members are confined to a specialized section of the facility called Sector 7, which offers them limited freedoms while remaining under constant surveillance. Sector 7 is equipped with specialized containment measures, including biohazardous-neutralizing barriers, automated lockdown systems, and controlled atmospheres to prevent mutation or further contamination.
ECHO members contribute to ELRB’s operations in controlled ways, often serving as test subjects, maintenance workers, or research assistants in areas deemed non-critical. While ELRB officially asserts their containment is "secure," leaked memos suggest growing concerns among staff about the long-term reliability of these "domesticated" aberrated individuals.

Selection Criteria
To qualify for the ECHO Group, aberrated individuals must meet strict criteria:
Demonstrated Stability: The subject must show no signs of violent tendencies or aggression over a six-month observation period.
Cognitive Retention: The subject must retain at least 80% of their pre-conversion memories and demonstrate reasoning skills.
Contaminate Limitation: The subject must not possess the ability to spread contamination actively.
Subjects failing to meet these criteria are either transferred to high-security containment zones or neutralized, depending on their threat level.





Daily Life in Sector 7
ECHO members are given access to communal facilities, such as:
A recreation lounge with a simulated outdoor environment.
Restricted access to the library and gym, shared with research staff during designated hours.
Private containment rooms resembling studio apartments, equipped with biohazardous-resistant materials.
While ECHO members appear to have a degree of freedom, their every move is monitored via hidden cameras and biometric sensors. Staff assigned to Sector 7 are equipped with non-lethal containment tools, such as disinfectant sprays and neuro-suppressant darts, in case of emergencies.

Concerns and Risks
Although officially considered secure, several incidents have raised doubts about the ECHO Group’s containment integrity:
Incident ECHO-4A: An ECHO member, formerly a high-ranking researcher, began exhibiting erratic behavior, claiming to hear "the Void" (#270-4) calling to them. The subject was immediately neutralized.
Cross-Contamination Risks: Researchers speculate that prolonged exposure to ECHO members could subtly influence unaberrated personnel. Psychological evaluations are now mandatory for all staff working in Sector 7.
Potential Hivemind Activation: There are concerns that latent connections to #270-4’s hivemind could exist in ECHO members, posing a catastrophic security risk should activation occur.

Closing Statement
The ECHO Group represents a delicate balance between containment and cooperation. As part of Experime1nt Labs' ongoing mission to push the boundaries of science, the inclusion of aberrated individuals in controlled operations is both a testament to human ingenuity and a reminder of the risks inherent in such experiments.
While ECHO members serve as a beacon of hope for managing the unmanageable, they also highlight the facility’s fragile grasp on its ever-expanding scope of research. With every success, the specter of failure looms closer, threatening to unravel the thin line between progress and catastrophe.
Experiment Labs remains steadfast in its commitment to innovation, driven by the belief that risk is the price of progress.

Researcher’s Note:
“Each step forward we take is shadowed by a choice—how far can we push before we are the ones consumed? The ECHO Group stands as both a victory and a warning: the unknown is not just what we seek to understand, but also what we must fear.”
