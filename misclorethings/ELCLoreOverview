ArcStar Reactor: Hidden console messages include playful notes from developers like “Do not push button labeled DOOM” or “We tried to warn you”.


Weird Lore Tidbits
ELRB cafeterias have a recurring, mysterious menu item called “Protein Surprise”, rumored to be leftover experiments (totally harmless… mostly).


ELRB lights-out policies have a hidden psychological effect on staff, sometimes causing hallucinations of minor aberrations wandering during downtime.


What If / Hypothetical Scenarios
Scenario 1: What if ArcStar went critical? How many sublevels would be lost? What would the fallout be for nearby cities?


Scenario 2: A rogue AI takes over multiple sub-bases—how would ELC handle the global diplomatic fallout?


Scenario 3: Hawke Station discovers a habitable exoplanet—what would ELC do: colonize, experiment, or weaponize?


Scenario 4: A global whistleblower leak occurs—ELC must bribe, sabotage, or reprogram all media sources to survive the PR catastrophe.


Scenario 5: Aberrations escape containment and temporarily inhabit ELRB—how does security, IAM staff, and the public respond?


Notes for Potential Future Games, and Teasers
ELRB Teaser: IAM member walking through the facility during downtime (lights out, subtle lore commentary, introduction to reactor, containment units, and aberrations).


Sub-bases Showcases: Smaller games could explore ELRB sub-bases like the European data center, Russian missile sub-base, or China material lab.
