# Experiment-Labs-Website

Welcome to the official (and slightly unstable) website for the underground research facility known as **Experiment Labs**.  

> _"No risk, no revolution."_ – Experiment Labs motto probably

This site is a mysterious, corporate-style interface built to represent the front-end of our *very normal and not at all dangerous* scientific facility.  
It serves as a digital access point for all things Experiment Labs: projects, logs, classified data (definitely redacted), and more.

- 🎨 CSS styling (we *tried* to be stylish)
- 📸 Background visuals hinting at obscure research
- 🖱️ Interactive buttons with hover effects and easter eggs

## 🚧 Work In Progress

This site is constantly being updated as we remember what the old layout looked like.  
More features and pages will be added as development continues. Expect:
- Better button interactions
- Page transitions
- Terminal-like elements
- And yes... more blur
